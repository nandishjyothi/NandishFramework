Data Driven:

-> Hybrid framework with POM design pattern (SRP)

POM: Martin folwer implemented POM
page:
  - For each and every page in the mobile app or web we need to create separate page java class
  - Never use assertions in page class
  - Page actions need to provide the page behavoiur  
  - Page locators(By) should be private and will be accessed via public page actions.

Test:
  - Have to use a test client: TestNG/Junit/pytest/NUnit/Jasmine/Mocha
  - assertions should be written in Test class
  - never use driver apis in test class
